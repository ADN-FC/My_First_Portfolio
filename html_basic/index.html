  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

  <p>
    This is my first portfolio website created as part of my learning journey
    with ALX. It represents the beginning of my path into web development.

    I am learning how to build websites using HTML and other web technologies.
    This project helps me understand the basic structure of a web page.

    My goal is to become a skilled software engineer and create useful
    applications that solve real-world problems.
